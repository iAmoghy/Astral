## Notes

There are some resources I have utilized that are quite difficult to cite individually - I've probably looked at more than 50 Stack Overflow articles throughout the course of this project, and the same is true for W3 Schools. It would be rather impractical for me to try and search for every single one, so instead, I have linked the main container websites. The same is also true for websites where I got my images from - I wasn't able to find each and every image (especially because I modified and edited most of them heavily), so instead I cited some of the main container websites I used like Freepik and PNGTree.

Lastly, a very unique source of information which helped me quite a bit through this project were two programming (primarily web-dev focused) Discord servers, which you can join [here](https://disboard.org/server/729943368364326952) and [here](https://discord.me/webdev). Although I didn't ask many questions myself, some of the issues and ideas other people were talking about greatly inspired my for my own project. I was also able to help out a few people myself!
